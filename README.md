# selenium-webdriver

Selenium is a browser automation library. Most often used for testing
web-applications, Selenium may be used for any task that requires automating
interaction with the browser.



You will need to download additional components to work with each of the major
browsers. The drivers for Chrome, Firefox, and Microsoft's IE and Edge web
browsers are all standalone executables that should be placed on your system
[PATH]. Apple's safaridriver (v10 and above) can be found at the
following path â€“ /usr/bin/safaridriver. To enable automation on safari,
you need to run command `safaridriver --enable`.
